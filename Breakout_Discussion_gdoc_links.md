**Breakout Instructions and Reports**

During the workshop we will have 4 breakout sessions labeled A, B, C, and D.  In each of these sessions we anticipate having 10 tables of parallel discussions on topics dynamically selected by the community.  We will also host at least 1 (2 if there are enough interested) remote Zoom-based discussion for remote participants to engage in parallel with the 10 local tables. 

Each of these 44 discussion groups will have a **scribe**, a **moderator**, and a **reporter**.  To make the scribe’s job easier, we have pre-created the 44 Google Docs and also filled each of those docs with prompts.  Below, we have included links to four folders, one associated with each session, containing these folders.  In this way, this document will provide a quick link for the scribe’s browser.

For each discussion group, the scribe will be chosen as the individual with the closest birthday **before** a random date selected for the session, and the moderator will be chosen as the individual with the closest birthday **after** the random date.  Each discussion group will select their own reporter.

During the report-back period, the document will be displayed for each breakout to provide the reporter a visual queue to guide the 5 minute-per-group report back on that session-table discussion.  It may be helpful for the group to read over and bold the most important points or prepare a summary at the bottom during the last few minutes of the discussion to make the reporter’s job a bit easier.
