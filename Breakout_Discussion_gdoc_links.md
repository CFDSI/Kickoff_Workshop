During the workshop we will have 4 breakout sessions labeled A, B, C, and D.  In each of these sessions we anticipate having 10 tables of parallel discussions on topics dynamically selected by the community.  We will also host at least 1 (2 if there are enough interested) remote Zoom-based discussion for remote participants to engage in parallel with the 10 local tables. 

Each of these 48 discussion groups will have a scribe, a moderator, and a reporter.  To make the scribe’s job easier we will pre-create the 48 Google Docs and also fill each of those docs with prompts.  Below we will “name” the document uniquely by the session letter dash table number (11 and 12 being virtual) and give the link to the right.  In this way, this document will provide a quick paste of the prepped document into the scribe’s browser.  

During the report-back period, the document will be displayed for each breakout to provide the reporter a visual queue to guide the 5 minute-per-group report back on that session-table discussion.  It may be helpful for the group to read over and bold the most important points or prepare a summary at the bottom during the last few minutes of the discussion to make the reporter’s job a bit easier.
